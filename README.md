# jmusicbot-docker
Dockerized version of [JMusicBot](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot).

I love running my server applications as Docker containers,
and this self-hosted Discord Youtube Music bot is no different.
This simple Docker image easily enables you to get a JMusicBot up and running.

## docker-compose
Here is a template docker-compose.yml to get you started:
```yml
